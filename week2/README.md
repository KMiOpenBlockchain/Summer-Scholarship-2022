# Week 2 Demo – Hash a TikTok Video File

## Overview
This folder contains the **Hash a TikTok Video File** demo created as part of the **KMi Summer Scholarship Blockchain Project (2022)**.

The demo showcases how to:
- Select a TikTok video file from your local machine
- Generate a cryptographic hash of the file
- Assign a meaningful name to the hash
- Store and view hashed data in a simple client-side table

This proof-of-concept demonstrates the first step towards verifying content integrity before minting NFTs.

## Features
- **File Hashing**: Compute a SHA-based hash of any selected video file using client-side JavaScript.
- **Local Storage**: Save hashes with labels for later reference.
- **Data Management**: Clear stored data when needed.
- **Responsive UI**: Simple HTML/CSS layout with dynamic updates.

## Notes
- This is a **client-side only** demo, intended for educational purposes during the scholarship.
- No blockchain interaction occurs in this demo – it focuses on hashing and local storage.
- No server-side code or backend services are included.
