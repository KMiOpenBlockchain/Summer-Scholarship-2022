## Overview
This repository archives the website produced as part of the **KMi Summer Scholarship Blockchain Project (2022)**.  
The site includes **client-side only demo pages** that were created during the project as proof-of-concept outputs.

We are preserving this content for **historical reference** and to document the work carried out during the scholarship.

## Project Summary
Challenge 3: Turning TikTok Content into NFTs  
Scholar: Peter Isagba  
Subject Area: Blockchains  
Supervisory Team: John Domingue, Aisling Third and Michelle Bachler

Empowering TikTok content creators to retain ownership of their content using NFTs.  
Peter worked on the subject of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the TikTok platform. He is studying computer science and was interested in the potential for economic disruption presented by NFTs.

Since its launch on the international market in September 2017, TikTok has taken the online world by storm. In 2021 CloudFare ranked TikTok as the number one website globally, usurping Google. The TikTok mobile app allows users to create short (15 second) videos with music that can be sped up, slowed down or filtered. NFTs or non-fungible tokens are non-interchangeable units of data stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain which can be used to prove ownership over a valuable asset. NFTs have appeared in the news recently for representing proof of ownership of digital artwork.

Peter combined these two hot technologies for his project.

See the Token Minter management page he built, to control who could mint tokens in his Token Contract: [peter/](./peter/)  

And this page contains details of his TikTok Tokens: [tokens/](./tokens/)  

“All of Peter's mentors were deeply impressed on how much he accomplished in a short space of time with such a tricky set of technologies (blockchains, smart contracts, NFTs and the TikTok APIs). We wish him best for his invariably bright future.”  
— John Domingue, Supervisor
